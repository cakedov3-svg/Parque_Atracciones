# Parque_Atracciones_IS2
An Object-Oriented Java system that automates the organization of events, invoice processing, and employee management for an amusement park.

Project done for Software Engineering during my second year at university. We implemented a backend that allowed it to support a custom persistence layer using JSON format text files and also a simple and intuitive GUI 
that provided the tools needed to access every feature available to the user. The team members that worked on the project were Jorge Arboleya, Rodrigo Cuadro, Candela Esparrica, Cristina Gomez, 
Ivan Nieto, Cameron Sanchez (https://github.com/cameronsanchezb) and me.
